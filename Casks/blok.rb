  caveats <<~EOS
    Blok isn't notarized yet. The first time you open it, macOS says it can't check it:
    open System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway" next to Blok.

    Blok then asks for Accessibility access (to capture selected text with ⇧⇧).
    Updates: Blok checks once a day and installs them itself (Settings ▸ General ▸ Updates).

    To use your notes from Claude Code: in Blok, … ▸ Connect to Claude… copies the
    setup command; paste it in Terminal.
